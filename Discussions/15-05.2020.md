### Discussion ###
* Cleanup labels
  * Add: coding style, story
  * Remove: dependencies, build
* [Start using the project board](https://github.com/orgs/vmck/projects/1)
* Discussion about Bachelor Thesis and alternatives for our system
  * GitHub + Jenkins/GitHubAction/Travis/CircleCI (on server)
    * Upside: learn git and see a real production system
    * Downside:
        * Student will have a forked private repo?
        * Each push will test the homework?
        * Grading (how to do that, Teaching Assistants making PRs into students repo?)
  * Integrate with an Excel - like a catalogue
