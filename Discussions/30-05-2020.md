### Discussion ###
* New label: test - testing scenarios
* Doing a lot of tests
* Discussed workflows:
  * Teaching Assistant Workflow:
      * Good Workflow:
        * See only assignments where you are a TA
        * Add/Modify/Delete assignment for the courses where you are a TA
        * Download homework for review (also check if TA for that course)
        * Add/Modify/Delete Review (it also checks the Grade - also check if TA for that course)
      * Bad Workflow:
        * Try to change submission where you are not a TA - should return error

  * Student Workflow:
      * Good Workflow:
        * Upload homework
        * Download homework
      * Bad Workflow:
        * Upload homework too many times -- should return an error
        * Download homework from someone else
        * Does not have the TA rights (grade/review an assignment)
