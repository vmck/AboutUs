### Discussion ###
* 390 submissions for Numerical Methods re-run indicated some problems
* the Zip extraction problem was also seen at Communication Protocols
* System is overloaded -- need to keep 4 machines (with too much average)
  * Add a general queue on this [PR](https://github.com/vmck/acs-interface/pull/187) for homeworks that are not having a deadline
  * Add 4 machines to keep up

### Work ###
* George
  * [issue](https://github.com/vmck/acs-interface/issues/179) - continue working on splitting the underlying hardware resources

* Misu
  * issues with zip extraction are not related to the builded machine
  * status can be viewed in [here](http://10.42.2.1:30849/grafana/?orgId=1) -- grafana
