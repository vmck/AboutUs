VMCK
====

VMCK is a system used in the [Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers](https://acs.pub.ro/)
for validating and grading the students' assignments.

This is the second version of an automatic grading system that should be easier to maintain.

The system was succesfully tested at the *Introduction to Computer Programming* course, for the CB and CD series.
